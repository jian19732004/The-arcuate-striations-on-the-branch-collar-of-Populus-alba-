Citation: The arcuate striations on the branch collar of Populus alba L. and its value in estimating the age of branch
Abstract: Populus alba is a commercial fast-growing species. There are clear arcuate striations on the branch collar of P. alba. The number of arcuate striations changes with the varieties of branch sizes. Total 32 branches and their arcuate striations were investigated to study the correlation between the number of arcuate striations and the branch age of P. alba plants. The correlation between the number of arcuate striations and that of tree rings was analysed. The results showed that the correlation between the number of arcuate striations at the branch base and that of tree rings in the branch was significant. The number of arcuate striations was highly consistent with the number of tree rings. The arcuate striations could be used to estimate the age of P. alba branches.
